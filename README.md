## What is it about?

Zenbu is a new, completely open-source database and tracking platform for all sorts of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese media, including but not limited to anime, manga, light novels, etc. We started as a team working on a project for AniList, but then had an idea of making an entire platform based around that project idea.

## Other GitHub repositories

Development of Zenbu is split into 2 separate parts: front-end and back-end. The development happens in separate repositories

- [`zenbu-front`](https://github.com/zenbu-moe/zenbu-front/) - front-end development repo for __zenbu.moe__
- [`zenbu-back`](https://github.com/zenbu-moe/zenbu-back/) - back-end development repo for __zenbu.moe__

Each repository contains a `main` branch for stable version deployment, as well as `dev-max` and `dev-kex` branches for development and testing. `zenbu-front` also has `landing` branch which houses the source code of the splash page that is currently (as of April 4, 2021) accessible through [`zenbu.moe`](https://zenbu.moe).
