# Roadmap

This is the current Zenbu development roadmap with major milestones.
Feel free to open issues to suggest features.

## Milestone 0 (Complete as of Dec 4, 2023)
- Initial design
- Basic database and API setup

## Milestone 1 - Basic site functionality
- Working search
- Fully functional submission pages for media, characters, and staff
- Login and registration
- Functional anime, manga, and light novel listing pages

## Milestone 2 - User pages
- Functional user pages
- Implement lists with basic functionality (add, remove, rearrange, group, etc)
- Other stuff that I haven't thought about yet

## Milestone 3 - Media pages
- Functional media pages

## Pre-release
At this point the site should have basic functionality to simply search for shows and add them to the lists.

## Milestone 4 - Forum & threads
- TBD

## Milestone 5 - Community features
- TBD (feed should become active in this update)

## Beta release
This is a good stopping point for a functional website with all the basic features, including social stuff and whatnot.
All development beyond this point will be focused on refining existing feature set and implementing more quality-of-life stuff.

## Final release - TBD
